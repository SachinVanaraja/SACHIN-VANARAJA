For my ITPRG Class 
Tic-Tac-Toe Game

Introduction:
This is a simple implementation of the Tic-Tac-Toe game in C++. The game allows two players to take turns marking cells on a 3x3 board, aiming to achieve a winning combination of their respective markers ('X' or 'O'). The game ends when one player wins or when the board is full, resulting in a tie.

Features:
- 3x3 game board represented using a 2D array.
- Two-player mode: Players take turns marking cells on the board.
- Simple AI opponent mode: An AI opponent makes random moves to compete against the player.
- Basic game logic: Checks for winning combinations and ties.
- User-friendly interface: Displays the game board and prompts players for input.
- Dynamic memory management: No dynamic memory allocation is used in this program.
- Object-oriented programming: The program is structured as a single-file C++ program with functions for different functionalities.
- Templates for generic programming: Not applicable in this implementation.
- Exception handling: No explicit exception handling is included in this version.
- Recursion: Not used in this implementation.

Usage:
1. Compile the program using a C++ compiler.
2. Run the compiled executable.
3. Choose the game mode:
   - Two-player mode: Players take turns entering row and column numbers to mark their moves.
   - AI opponent mode: The player competes against an AI opponent that makes random moves.
4. Follow the prompts to play the game.
5. The game ends when one player wins or when there is a tie.

There is a video for you to see how the program works.
